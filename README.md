## Introduction

In our lab, we focus on a wide range of research areas, spanning from computational biology to experimental biology. This repository is designed to organize and share the resources that support our research. Feel free to explore the sections below to find what you need.

## Dry Lab Protocols

Our Dry Lab protocols section contains detailed documentation on computational and analysis protocols. Whether you're working on data analysis, modeling, or simulations, you'll find valuable guides and scripts here to assist you.

- [Protocol 1: Name](./protocol1.md)
- [Protocol 2: Name](./protocol2.md)
- [Protocol 3: Name](./protocol3.md)

## Wet Lab Pipelines

The Wet Lab Pipelines section provides information and instructions for experimental procedures, laboratory techniques, and data generation processes. If you're conducting experiments, this is the place to start.

- [Pipeline 1: ATAC-seq](./ATAC-seq.md)
- [Pipeline 2: ChIP-seq](./ChIP-seq.md)
- [Pipeline 3: RNA-seq](./RNA-seq.md)

## Public Datasets

We believe in open science and sharing resources with the broader scientific community. In the Public Datasets section, you can find publicly available datasets that we have used or curated. These datasets may be valuable for your research.

- [Dataset 1: Name](./public-datasets/dataset1.md)
- [Dataset 2: Name](./public-datasets/dataset2.md)
- [Dataset 3: Name](./public-datasets/dataset3.md)

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from lab members and the wider community. If you have a Dry Lab protocol, Wet Lab pipeline, or public dataset that you would like to share, please contact us.
